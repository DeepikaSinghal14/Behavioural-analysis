Overview

This project integrates and analyzes multiple behavioral datasets to identify consistent patterns of pain and stress responses across experimental models. The goal was to generate evidence-based, quantitative insights to guide the design of molecular neuroscience experiments investigating sex-specific neuroimmune mechanisms of chronic pain.

1. Objectives

Combine behavioral data from multiple studies into a unified analytical framework.

Quantify the strength and variability of behavioral effects (e.g., hypersensitivity, anxiety-like behaviors) using meta-analytic statistics.

Visualize effect sizes and confidence intervals through forest plots.

Translate data-driven insights into actionable recommendations for experimental design and resource allocation in neuroscience research.

2. Methodology

Data Collection – Extracted behavioral endpoints (e.g., withdrawal thresholds, locomotion, stress indices) from multiple independent datasets.

Data Harmonization – Standardized variables, scales, and effect measures across studies.

3. Statistical Analysis –

Computed effect sizes (Hedges’ g, Cohen’s d).

Conducted random-effects meta-analysis using R (metafor and meta packages).

Evaluated heterogeneity (I², τ²) and performed sensitivity analyses.

Visualization – Generated forest plots to summarize study-level and overall effect estimates.

Interpretation – Derived recommendations for designing next-phase molecular studies (e.g., identifying robust behavioral markers for microglial activation studies).

4. Key Results

Identified consistent sex-dependent behavioral differences under chronic stress exposure.

Quantified variability in effect sizes across experiments, improving reproducibility planning.

Forest plots illustrated significant behavioral convergence supporting model validity for downstream omics experiments.
